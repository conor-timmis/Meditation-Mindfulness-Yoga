This is my Meditation, Mindfulness & Yoga website. My website is designed to plant a seed in peoples brains to take the saying "my body is a temple" to a whole new level, for people that are unknowing this will be a solid introduction. The aim of my page is to introduce these 3 ideas to the user in hopes of helping them better themselves mentally and physically. I am using information I have personally written to convey my message in both anecdotal and factual form. I call it Timmys.

With my Page, I'm trying to introduce all of my topics to the user. As someone who was heavily introverted and very ignorant I have became very open-minded, and much less introverted. I myself wouldn't be able to speak to new people easily before and now I can talk to anyone completely new, I don't find interacting nearly as tough, and going out nearly as stressful. I was also very opinionated and very "overly" caring of just about everything when I should've been letting the small things go. I want to bring this way of life to much more people around the world, bringing more people together and having less of the close-mindedness that I feel like we have today. I feel like my sites main use is to plant the seed in the users mind mostly, with what I have given, but this I feel is just a foundation and where people want to take it when they have read/learned of these subjects is up to them, and I have made it this way because I think having someone too hands on actually hinders the learning of the person. This way they will engage their brain much more, get them thinking and learning out of interest once they make their first steps.
