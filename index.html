            <h3>What Is Meditation?</h3>
            <p>Meditation is a practice that will bring focus to the situation you want it to, the purpose of this is to give you a clear thought process in the moment and better your mind overall by being within your own realm. The main benefit of meditation is to reduce your stress by being able to process and think clearly overall, being able to meditate often will bring you a less stress, to better everything around you in your day-to-day life.</p>

            <h3>Personal Experience/Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Overall, I have around 2.5 years of experience in meditation, I typically do it on days off and times where life can be stressful, for example after a long day at work. I like to get around 20-30 minutes in per session. I use it as a temporary escape to balance myself, and it is much more healthy to use this than to rely on prescriptions.</p>

            <h3>How Can I Get Started?</h3>
            <p>Below I want to leave you with a video you can try for yourself, as I have used it plenty in the past and especially when I first started out:</p>

            <h3>What is Mindfulness?</h3>
            <p>Mindfulness can be described in many different ways, but to me it's about how you are responding to situations around you, making surely you react appropriately to the situation in the moment. It's important to keep a mindful approach to your surroundings and knowing the time and place. Though it expands much more further in many different ways.</p>

            <h3>My Personal Journey</h3>
            <p>As someone that went through drastic changes, introvert to extrovert, being completely opinionated to less-caring generally, I feel like a totally different person since starting my journey 4 years ago. My life felt like it was on a plateau and I needed to do something about it to move forward, though this is just a way of me describing it on a surface level. This is usually the point in where you should be looking to change in my opinion. Now I have grown all-round and developed all kinds of skills rather than being someone that didn't look at life the way it should be looked at, and even today I am learning something new!</p>

            <h3>Try an example!</h3>
            <p>Here is a video that was recommended to me back when I was still new to the idea of becoming a mindful person. I had just practiced my own little techniques beforehand but this ended up being recommended eventually through youtubes algorithm.</p>
